Spotify - Mute Ads
====================

This little script aim to shut off the sound when spotify vocal ads are playing. 
It detects the title of the current track in the wine window.

If Spotify detects that the sound is muted, this software pull up a little the sound, 
to avoid automatic pause of Spotify Ad.

The Software is licenced under GNU/GPL v2, so feel free to make changes !
